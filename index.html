                        Hi and thanks for dropping by!  My name is Chuck and I luv to work on stuff and fix things.  I don't care what it is, if it's not working right - I'll take a crack at fixing it back up.  Of course my experiences are limited to ordinary everyday stuff like cars &amp; trucks, motorcycles, farm equipment, computers, electronics, home maintenance, electrical &amp; plumbing, welding, and of course software.  Software is in some ways easier to work on than other systems, yet in many ways it is more challenging, but in the end when everything is working like it should be -- the sense of accomplishment with software is just as great as hearing an old Harley Davidson come roaring back to life.  Also, just because I've never fixed a flux capacitor doesn't mean I wouldn't lug a broken one into my garage to take a crack at it.  So drop me a note on my <a class="inlink" href="./contact.html">Contact</a> page and let's build something together!
